# Pixel Perfect
### Pixel Perfect is a project where you can make a picture using text editor! It's big because of no compression, but it can open instantly!

### Make sure you have installed PYTHON 3.8 or higher + Pillow library
To check, type following commands to command prompt:  
python --version - must print 3.8 or higher
pip install pillow - must print Requirement already satisfied, else wait for it to download.

# How to use:
The syntax is so easy! You only need to type:  
size W H (size of the picture)  
A4F589 44FADC 90A8BB etc. (colors one-by-one - 1 row - 1 row, 1 column - 1 color in the row)  
Once you finish the image and rename to .pxp (or just simply convert from png), you can open PXP opener, click OPEN and select your file.
## Enjoy your 'lightweight' image!
